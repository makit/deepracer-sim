A Racing Line can be calculated using:

https://github.com/cdthompson/deepracer-k1999-race-lines/blob/master/Race-Line-Calculation.ipynb

The resulting npy file can be stored in here with the same name as the track.

The code then dynamically loads the racing-line for display if a file exists.
